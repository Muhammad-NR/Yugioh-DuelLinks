                 ● Not Brick (by playing lots of despias so the skill is always live)
                 ● Get to "Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"
                 ● Get "Darklord Morningstar"
                 ● Get "Branded in Red" so you can clear board on your opponent turn.
              
                 The "Going 1st" Combo
                      
            1. Use skill to add either Tragedy or Dramaturge, whichever you dont have.
            2. Use field to fuse the two, making "Masquerade the Blazing Dragon" in the middle of the main monster zone.
            3. Special Summon Dramaturge after the fusion, and add Aluber from Tragedy's effect
            4. Normal Aluber, add Branded in Red.
            5. Link Aluber and Dramaturge into Condemned Darklord.
            6. Use Condemned Darklord to discard a card to get Darklord Morningstar. Preferably disscarding Branded Opening for Graveyard protection for your fusion monsters from destruction.

            Note that using Branded Opening WILL lock you to fusions, so dont use it if you have a path to Condemned Darklord.

    This combo uses the 1 Despia you'll have in hand, a discard for Condemned Darklord and your skill, which means youre likely to stay with 2 more cards in hand which could be your other non-engine.

    Going 2nd My recommandation is to not underestimate Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, sometimes that card alone can be the game ender, attacking into a small monster using the ATK of something else the opponent has, especially if Quearitis resoved earlier. I Usually make sure i still get Tragedy and Dramaturge, since your skill will get you Branded in Red, you're mostly good to go.

    I like to send Ad Libitum to the Graveyard with the 2nd Skill effect, for extantion and revival if needed. In some cases the best cards to send to grave with your skills will be:

    Aluber
            ● When you see that your opponent WILL destroy your first fusion and you have no way to save it with Branded Opening, Aluber in grave will trigger and negate 1 of their monsters.
    Comedy
            ● When your opponent has target negation, such as Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermenance, or Swordsoul Chixiao. Tributing your Fusion monster will allow you to dodge those kind of effects.`},{id:"3",name:"Sky Striker",tier:"A",description:"A control deck that grinds out resources while maintaining field presence with link monsters and powerful spell cards.",skill:"Sky Striker Ace Defying Fate",skillType:"Universal",winRate:54,usage:15,difficulty:9,popularity:3,mainCards:["Sky Striker Ace - Raye","Sky Striker Ace - Roze","Surgical Striker - H.A.M.P.","Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!","Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!","Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!","Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor","Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor","Sky Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster","Sky Striker Mecha - Shark Cannon","Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves!","Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!","Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!","Sky Striker Mobilize - Linkage!","Sky Striker Mobilize - Linkage!","Mystical Space Typhoon","Mystical Space Typhoon"],extraCards:["Sky Striker Ace - Hayate","Sky Striker Ace - Kaina","Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku","Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku","Sky Striker Ace - Zeke","Sky Striker Ace - Zeke","Sky Striker Ace - Kagari","Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"],strategy:"The Sky Striker deck is a control-oriented deck that focuses on maintaining field presence through the use of Link Monsters and powerful Spell Cards.
